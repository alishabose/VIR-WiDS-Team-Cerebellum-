## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview
This project is part of the **WiDS Datathon 2025** in collaboration with **Break Through Tech AI Program**. The challenge focuses on building predictive models using neuroimaging data to determine ADHD diagnosis and sex based on patterns in brain activity. By doing so, the work aims to contribute to improving diagnostic accuracy for ADHD in males and females, providing more accurate and personalized treatment approaches.

## üìä Data Exploration
The dataset provided in the Kaggle competition includes:
- **Categorical Metadata**: Information about participants, including demographics and behavioral data.
- **Functional Connectome Matrices (FCM)**: Data related to brain activity from neuroimaging.
- **Quantitative Metadata**: Neuroimaging measures for functional connectivity and brain regions.

### Data Preprocessing Approach:
- **Encoding categorical variables** using `pd.get_dummies`.
- **Handling missing values** by filling them with the mean of respective columns.
- **Feature scaling** using `StandardScaler` to normalize numeric features.
  
### Challenges:
- Dealing with missing values in large datasets.
- Aligning different data types (categorical, numeric, and matrix data).
  
### Visualizations:

## üß† Model Development
### Model Used:
- **Random Forest Classifier** was chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and provide insights into feature importance.

### Feature Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Applied **multi-output classification** to predict both ADHD diagnosis and sex simultaneously.
- **GridSearchCV** could be used for hyperparameter tuning if further optimization is needed.

### Training Setup:
- Split the data into training and validation sets using `train_test_split`.
- Used **accuracy score** to evaluate the performance of the model.

## üìà Results & Key Findings
### Performance Metrics:
- **Accuracy score**: [insert accuracy score] based on the model's performance in the Kaggle leaderboard.

### Key Findings:
- The model was able to identify brain activity patterns that distinguish between different ADHD diagnoses and sex categories.

### Visualizations:
- Confusion matrix for model performance.
- Precision-recall curve to assess classification performance.
- Feature importance plot to understand which features were most influential in predictions.

## üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative
ADHD is linked to brain activity patterns, specifically within the **default mode network** and **executive function regions**. ADHD diagnosis shows differences in male and female presentations, including varying attention and impulse control patterns. Better understanding of these differences through brain activity analysis will enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment methods for ADHD.

## üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements
### Limitations:
- The current model‚Äôs performance is constrained by limited compute power on Kaggle (free CPU usage).
  
### What Would You Do Differently With More Time/Resources?
- Apply advanced deep learning techniques such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to capture more intricate patterns in brain activity.

### Additional Datasets or Techniques to Explore:
- Explore **ADHD Teen Integrative Data Analysis Longitudinal (TIDAL)** dataset, which focuses specifically on adolescents with ADHD.
