## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**


ADHD is linked to the default mode network and executive function regions of the brain, and patterns of increased theta waves and decreased beta waves.
Males and females tend to have different patterns of brain activiation, with differences in attention and impulse control.
A better understanding of brain activity patterns and differences in the presentation of ADHD in males and females improves diagnostic accuracy and enhances treatment.

## **🚀 Next Steps & Future Improvements**

* What are some of the limitations of your model?
      The free CPU on Kaggle is slow.
* What would you do differently with more time/resources?
      Used more advanced techniques like neural networks (CNNs and GNNs).
* What additional datasets or techniques would you explore?
      ADHD Teen Integrative Data Analysis Longitudinal (TIDAL), which focuses on adolescents specifically.
